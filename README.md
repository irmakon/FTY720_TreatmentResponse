# FTY720_TreatmentResponse
## Aim
This README file explains how the code in this repository transforms and analyzes the data retrieved via [Clinical Study Data Request](https://www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com) ([Proposal 11223](https://www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com/Posting.aspx?ID=20600&GroupID=SUMMARIES)) from the sponsor (Novartis) of the FREEDOMS and FREEDOMS II randomized clinical trials to generate the [PhD thesis](https://edoc.ub.uni-muenchen.de/32918/) of Begum Irmak On submitted to [LMU Munich](https://www.lmu.de).

## Folder [DataManagement](https://github.com/irmakon/FTY720_TreatmentResponse/tree/main/DataManagement)
This folder contains SAS codes to transform the “raw” data tables shared by the sponsor into datasets required for the analysis. In order to define the outcomes and choose/define the predictors, the data is described in the files named “basicdesc”
